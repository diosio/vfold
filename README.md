VFOLD library
=============

Use this library to build your vfold platform. Contains all core functionality for adding applications, tools, desktops, and widgets.

Things in there you should know about:
-------

* ### Runtime Shared Libraries (RSL), but better! Your vfold components or custom libraries.

    When you start a project in vfold you will want to load in your applications, desktops, widgets, or tools (the vfold components). Your libraries are apart from vfold in separate compiled SWFs. You can load in as many RSLs you want on runtime. Your libraries will be cached in your browser, and instantly load in your platform upon request. Plus, your vfold component (or a simple library) can be dependant on someone's else library (as long as you specify the class path).

* ### Your Components

    There is a nice API for you to develop your components quickly and easily. The library is still lacking, but more work to come!


* ### Workspaces

    A container of all defined components belonging to it. In workspaces, you keep things tidy.

* ### The Dashboard

    VFOLD's default workspace for viewing and managing your entire platform. There is work yet to come on this area. Still in early development stage.
